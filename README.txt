These files are all .sql ones. Please run lyra_co.sql first, and then run lyra_co2.sql. If you do it correctly, you'll have a database called lyrainsurance. It'll only make sense if I give you the context. 
Lyra co is a fictional health insurance company made 
by My Little Pony character, lyra heartstrings, 
and this is their current database. 

When you start up the first file, it will also demonstrate 
my current skills in mysql. If you don't want to go through that 
part, use the file called "lyra_co_database.sql". Have fun!
